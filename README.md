# Frogger-Game
---
## Technologies
  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. JS
  4. Game-Loop-Engine
## Specification
  1. Player can not move off screen
  2. Vehicles cross the screen
  3. Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
  4. Vehicle-player collision resets the game
  5. Something happens when player wins

## Implementation
  This is classic arcade game design with just HTML, CSS and JS. Here I used game loop engine and canvas to make enemy and vehicle (bugs) move smoothly.
